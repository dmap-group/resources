This is a TESTING virtual machine running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Server Edition for centralized CoDMAP track.

TL;DR (I just want to try my planner now!)
------------------------------------------
 1) go to planner1/ dir, upload (and compile) your planner here
 2) update planner1/plan.sh such that it runs your planner with the right parameters (look for
    a "REPLACE BY CODE RUNNING YOUR PLANNER" comment)
 3) run run.sh planner1

 !) the testing machines are shared among all competition participants, so (a) do not expect
 realistic results by means of run times and (b) please, be kind to other competitors by not
 using the machines for longer time and more planning problems than necessary for testing of your
 planner in the target environment.


Directory structure
-------------------

* benchmarks               --- directory with the competition domains and problems
** unfactored              --- MA-PDDL unfactored variant of the bechmarks (see CoDMAP webpage for description of MA-PDDL)
*** driverlog              --- first benchmark set (driverlog)
**** pfile1                --- first driverlog problem
***** domain.pddl          --- first driverlog domain PDDL
***** problem.pddl         --- first driverlog problem PDDL
**** pfile2                --- second driverlog problem
**** ...                   --- other driverlog problems
*** logistics              --- second benchmark set (logistics)
*** ...                    --- other benchmark sets
** factored                --- MA-PDDL factored variant of the benchmarks (see CoDMAP webpage for description of MA-PDDL)
*** driverlog              --- first benchmark set (driverlog)
**** pfile1                --- first driverlog problem
***** domain-driver1.pddl  --- first driverlog domain PDDL for the agent driver1
***** domain-driver2.pddl  --- first driverlog domain PDDL for the agent driver2
***** problem-driver1.pddl --- first driverlog problem PDDL for the agent driver1
***** problem-driver2.pddl --- first driverlog problem PDDL for the agent driver2
**** pfile2                --- second driverlog problem
**** ...                   --- other driverlog problems
*** logistics              --- second benchmark set (logistics)
*** ...                    --- other benchmark sets
* planner1                 --- your first planner (or first configuration of your planner)
** plan.sh                 --- interface script running your planner with the right parameters
** <your planner's files>  --- your planner goes here
* planner2                 --- your second planner (or second configuration of your planner)
* ...                      --- other planners or configurations or common files for your planners
* howto.txt                --- you are here
* run.sh                   --- this script emulates how we will run all the planners and validate the plans


Configurations of the same planner
----------------------------------

If you have only one planner, but you need to use it in more configurations, you can use different
parameterizations of the planner in the planner1/plan.sh, planner2/plan.sh, etc scripts and reuse
only one compiled planner in a common dir, for instance common-planner/ in root of your team's
directory (i.e., next to the benchmarks, planner1, ... dirs). Then you simply call the planner from
plan.sh as ../common-planner/your-planner with different parameters for planner1, planner2, etc.


Factored or unfactored input?
-----------------------------

You can use whatever input files you want. You can even combine them if it suits your planner. In
this track, there are no hard constraints on this. More information can be found on the CoDMAP
webpage.
