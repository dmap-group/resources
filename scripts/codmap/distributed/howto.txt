This is a TESTING virtual machine running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Server Edition for distributed CoDMAP track.

TL;DR (I just want to try my planner now!)
------------------------------------------
 1) go to planner1/ dir, upload (and compile) your planner here
 2) update planner1/plan.sh such that it runs your planner with the right parameters (look for
    a "REPLACE BY CODE RUNNING YOUR PLANNER" comment)
 3) run run.sh planner1

 !) the testing machines are shared among all competition participants, so (a) do not expect
 realistic results by means of run times and (b) please, be kind to other competitors by not
 using the machines for longer time and more planning problems than necessary for testing of your
 planner in the target environment.


Directory structure
-------------------

* benchmarks               --- directory with the competition domains and problems
** factored                --- MA-PDDL factored variant of the benchmarks (see CoDMAP webpage for description of MA-PDDL)
*** driverlog              --- first benchmark set (driverlog)
**** pfile1                --- first driverlog problem
***** domain-driver1.pddl  --- first driverlog domain PDDL for the agent driver1
***** domain-driver2.pddl  --- first driverlog domain PDDL for the agent driver2
***** problem-driver1.pddl --- first driverlog problem PDDL for the agent driver1
***** problem-driver2.pddl --- first driverlog problem PDDL for the agent driver2
**** pfile2                --- second driverlog problem
**** ...                   --- other driverlog problems
*** logistics              --- second benchmark set (logistics)
*** ...                    --- other benchmark sets
* planner1                 --- your first planner (or first configuration of your planner)
** plan.sh                 --- interface script running your planner's process with the right parameters
** <your planner's files>  --- your planner goes here
* planner2                 --- your second planner (or second configuration of your planner)
* ...                      --- other planners or configurations or common files for your planners
* ip.list                  --- list of available IP addresses in the cluster (used by run.sh)
* agent.list (temporary)   --- a file generated by the run.sh script containing agent names
* agent-ip.list (temporary)--- a file generated by the run.sh script containing agents and their IP addresses usable by the planners
* howto.txt                --- you are here
* run.sh                   --- this script emulates how we will run all the planners and validate the plans


Configurations of the same planner
----------------------------------

If you have only one planner, but you need to use it in more configurations, you can use different
parameterizations of the planner in the planner1/plan.sh, planner2/plan.sh, etc scripts and reuse
only one compiled planner in a common dir, for instance common-planner/ in root of your team's
directory (i.e., next to the benchmarks, planner1, ... dirs). Then you simply call the planner from
plan.sh as ../common-planner/your-planner with different parameters for planner1, planner2, etc.


The distributed process
-----------------------

The run.sh script firstly copies complete content of your team's directory to all machines defined
in the ip.list. Then in parallel, it runs the plan.sh scripts on all the machines and after
finishing (or timeout) of all the calls it gathers the generated plans to the primary machine (the
one the run.sh was run from). A centralized plan is generated by LINearization and the result is
VALidated. In the end, the results are printed to the standard output.

*IMPORTANT*: We keep open ssh connections during planning to all processes of the planner
 distributed over the machines (for easier debugging and control), therefore all output the planner
 peers generate goes encrypted over the network to the primary machine. If you want to utilize full
 power of the machines and the network do not generate much output in the final version of the
 planner.
